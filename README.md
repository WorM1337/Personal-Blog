# Personal Blog Web Application
### By using is you can publish articles as an *admin*, and view as a *guest*.
**Arctile** is a complex of title, date and text. 
## What about realisation?
This a *backend*-based application with light *frontend* (frontend provides only fetches with backend).
Backend - **ASP.NET** Core with **Postgres** or **MongoDB** (you can choose one updating a "*CurrentDatabase*" in *appsettings.json* with "*PostgreSQL*" or "*MongoDB*")
Frontend - HTML + JS + SCSS application
